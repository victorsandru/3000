1. code
2. a. finit_module()
b. mmap is needed when using insmod because insmod uses finit_module(), which loads a kernel module from a file descriptor.
As a result, finit_module needs to access user space so mmap creates the mapping between kernel and user space. After the call, munmap
is called to close the mapping
3. When giving a redirection with /dev/tcp/host_name/port_number, bash tries to open a TCP socket instead of opening the file of the specified file.
Normally when calling cat, it opens and displays the content of the file, but with the redirection operator, it opens a TCP socket at that address:port.
Since using the redirection operator tries to open a TCP socket, there is no guarantee that the file actually exists. So when a user tries to do ls or cat, there is no file to open.
The TCP directory is a directory reserved by bash to create direct network connections within the shell. Thus no file exists there.
