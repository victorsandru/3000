3. You can run a program in the background by outputting an stderr code and letting the process finish on its own.
You can also add an & at the end of the command
4. The input and output of each program changes, and nothing happens sometimes. it also provides the process ID and prints it out when it dies.
5. you can use CTRL+C to send a sigint to the shell and interuppt the current process running.
6. you can use the '>' operator to make a new file with the output of the command to be written in it. use >> to append.

8. if a system call is interuppted, the program will not retry since the SA_RESTART flags specifies that.
